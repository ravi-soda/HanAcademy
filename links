Elasticsearch is developed alongside a data-collection and log-parsing engine called Logstash, and an analytics and visualisation platform called Kibana. The three products are designed for use as an integrated solution, referred to as the "Elastic Stack" (formerly the "ELK stack").

KIBANA is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.[3]

The combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (also known as ELK stack or Elastic stack) is available as products or service.[4] Logstash provides an input stream to Elastic for storage and search, and Kibana accesses the data for visualizations such as dashboards.[5]
